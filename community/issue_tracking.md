# Tracking Issues

A great way to contribute is by reporting issues. Before reporting an issue,
please review the current open issues to see if someone has already reported
the issue.

## Github Issues

Hyperledger Sawtooth uses Github Issues as our issue tracking system. The
issues are tied to the repository in which the related code resides. For
example:

* [sawtooth-core](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/issues) - Issues
    related to the validator, REST API, etc.
* [sawtooth-docs](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-docs/issues) - Issues
    related to content on the website.

## How to Report an Issue

To report issues, find the related Sawtooth GitHub repository and open an issue
there.  If in doubt, open an issue against the
[sawtooth-core](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/issues)
repository.

When reporting an issue, please provide as much detail as possible about how
to reproduce it. If possible, explain how to reproduce the issue.
Details are very helpful. Please include the following information:

* OS version
* Sawtooth version
* Environment details (virtual, physical, etc.)
* Steps to reproduce the issue
* Actual results
* Expected results

If you would like, you could also describe the issue on Discord
(see [Joining the Discussion](./join_the_discussion.html))
for initial feedback before submitting the issue in JIRA.

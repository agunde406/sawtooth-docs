# Application Developer's Guide

This guide describes how to develop applications which run on top of the
Sawtooth core platform, primarily through the
use of Sawtooth's provided SDKs and `REST API`.

Topics include an overview of Sawtooth transaction families setting up an
application development environment, learning Sawtooth concepts with an example
client, and tutorials on using the Sawtooth SDKs to write the business logic for
your application.

Sawtooth provides SDKs in several languages, including Python,
Javascript, Go, C++, Java, and Rust. This guide has tutorials for using
the Go, Javascript, and Python SDKs.

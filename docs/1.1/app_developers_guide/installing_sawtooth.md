# Setting Up a Sawtooth Application Development Environment

Before you can start developing for the *Sawtooth* platform,
you\'ll need to set up and run a local validator to test your
application against. Once running, you will be able to submit new
transactions and fetch the resulting state and block data from the
blockchain using HTTP and the Sawtooth REST API. The methods detailed
here will apply to the included example transaction families,
*IntegerKey* and *XO*, as well as any transaction families you might
write yourself.

You can install and run a simple, single-node Sawtooth application
development environment on one of the following platforms:

- Docker: Run Sawtooth from prebuilt [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
containers.
- Ubuntu: Install Sawtooth natively using [Ubuntu
16.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/).
- Amazon Web Services (AWS): Launch Sawtooth in AWS from the [AWS
Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B075TKQCC2).
- Kubernetes: Run Sawtooth in a single-node
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster inside a virtual machine on
your computer.

To get started, choose the guide for the platform of your choice.

> The guides in this chapter set up an environment with one Sawtooth
> validator node. For a multiple-node environment, see
> [creating_sawtooth_network](creating_sawtooth_network).

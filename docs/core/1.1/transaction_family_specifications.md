# Transaction Family Specifications

Sawtooth includes several transaction families as examples for
developing your own transaction family.

-   The
    `/transaction_family_specifications/blockinfo_transaction_family`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} provides a way to store information about a configurable
    number of historic blocks. BlockInfo is written in Python. The
    family name is `block_info`; the associated transaction processor is
    `block-info-tp`.

-   The
    `/transaction_family_specifications/identity_transaction_family`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} is an extensible role- and policy-based system for
    defining permissions in a way that can be used by other Sawtooth
    components. Identity is written in Python. The family name is
    `sawtooth_identity`; the associated transaction processor is
    `identity-tp` (see `/cli/identity-tp`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}).

-   The
    `/transaction_family_specifications/integerkey_transaction_family`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} simply sets, increments, and decrements the value of
    entries stored in a state dictionary. IntegerKey is available in Go,
    Java, and JavaScript (Node.js). The family name is `intkey`; the
    associated transaction processor executables are `intkey-tp-go`, and
    `intkey-tp-java`; the processor in its own repo is
    [JavaScript](https://github.com/splintercommunity/sawtooth-sdk-javascript/blob/master/examples/intkey/).
    The `intkey command </cli/intkey>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
    provides an example CLI client.

-   The
    `/transaction_family_specifications/validator_registry_transaction_family`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} provides a way to add new validators to the network. It
    is used by the PoET consensus algorithm implementation to keep track
    of other validators. The family name is
    `sawtooth_validator_registry`. The transaction processor is
    `poet-validator-registry-tp`.

-   The
    `/transaction_family_specifications/settings_transaction_family`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} provides a methodology for storing on-chain
    configuration settings. Settings is written in Python. The family
    name is `sawtooth_settings`; the associated transaction processor is
    `settings-tp` (see `/cli/settings-tp`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}). The `sawset command </cli/sawset>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} provides an example CLI client.

    Note
    :::

    In a production environment, you should always run a transaction
    processor that supports the Settings transaction family.

-   The
    `/transaction_family_specifications/smallbank_transaction_family`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} provides a cross-platform workload for comparing the
    performance of blockchain systems. Smallbank is written in Go. The
    family name is `smallbank`; the associated transaction processor is
    `smallbank-tp`.

-   The
    `/transaction_family_specifications/xo_transaction_family`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} allows two users to play a simple game of tic-tac-toe
    (see
    `/app_developers_guide/intro_xo_transaction_family`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}). XO is written in Go, JavaScript/Node.js, and Python.
    The family name is `xo`; the associated transaction processor
    executables are `xo-tp-go`, and `xo-tp-python`; the processor in its
    own repo is
    [JavaScript](https://github.com/splintercommunity/sawtooth-sdk-javascript/blob/master/examples/xo/).
    The `xo command </cli/xo>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} provides an
    example CLI client.

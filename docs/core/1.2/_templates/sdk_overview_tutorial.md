This tutorial shows how to use the Sawtooth {{ language }} SDK to
develop a simple application (also called a transaction family). A
transaction family includes these components:

-   A **transaction processor** to define the business logic for your
    application. The transaction processor is responsible for
    registering with the validator, handling transaction payloads and
    associated metadata, and getting/setting state as needed.
-   A **data model** to record and store data.
-   A **client** to handle the client logic for your application. The
    client is responsible for creating and signing transactions,
    combining those transactions into batches, and submitting them to
    the validator. The client can post batches through the REST API or
    connect directly to the validator via [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org).

The client and transaction processor must use the same data model,
serialization/encoding method, and addressing scheme.

In this tutorial, you will construct a transaction handler that
implements XO, a distributed version of the two-player game
[tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

This tutorial also describes how a client can use the {{ language }} SDK
to create transactions and submit them as
`Sawtooth batches<batch>`{.interpreted-text role="term"}.

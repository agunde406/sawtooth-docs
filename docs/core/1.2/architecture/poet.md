The Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) Consensus method offers a solution to
the Byzantine Generals Problem that utilizes a "trusted execution
environment" to improve on the efficiency of present solutions such as
Proof-of-Work. The initial reference implementation of PoET was written for an
abstract TEE to keep it flexible to any
TEE implementation. This specification defines a concrete implementation
for SGX. The following presentation assumes the use of Intel SGX as the
trusted execution environment.

At a high-level, PoET stochastically elects individual peers to execute
requests at a given target rate. Individual peers sample an
exponentially distributed random variable and wait for an amount of time
dictated by the sample. The peer with the smallest sample wins the
election. Cheating is prevented through the use of a trusted execution
environment, identity verification and blacklisting based on asymmetric
key cryptography, and an additional set of election policies.

For the purpose of achieving distributed consensus efficiently, a good
lottery function has several characteristics:

> -   Fairness: The function should distribute leader election across
>     the broadest possible population of participants.
> -   Investment: The cost of controlling the leader election process
>     should be proportional to the value gained from it.
> -   Verification: It should be relatively simple for all participants
>     to verify that the leader was legitimately selected.

PoET is designed to achieve these goals using new secure CPU
instructions which are becoming widely available in consumer and
enterprise processors. PoET uses these features to ensure the safety and
randomness of the leader election process without requiring the costly
investment of power and specialized hardware inherent in most "proof"
algorithms.

Sawtooth includes an implementation which simulates the secure
instructions. This should make it easier for the community to work with
the software but also forgoes Byzantine fault tolerance.

PoET essentially works as follows:

1.  Every validator requests a wait time from an enclave (a trusted
    function).
2.  The validator with the shortest wait time for a particular
    transaction block is elected the leader.
3.  One function, such as "CreateTimer", creates a timer for a
    transaction block that is guaranteed to have been created by the
    enclave.
4.  Another function, such as "CheckTimer", verifies that the timer was
    created by the enclave. If the timer has expired, this function
    creates an attestation that can be used to verify that the validator
    did wait the allotted time before claiming the leadership role.

The PoET leader election algorithm meets the criteria for a good lottery
algorithm. It randomly distributes leadership election across the entire
population of validators with distribution that is similar to what is
provided by other lottery algorithms. The probability of election is
proportional to the resources contributed (in this case, resources are
general purpose processors with a trusted execution environment). An
attestation of execution provides information for verifying that the
certificate was created within the enclave (and that the validator
waited the allotted time). Further, the low cost of participation
increases the likelihood that the population of validators will be
large, increasing the robustness of the consensus algorithm.

# Definitions

The following terms are used throughout the PoET spec and are defined
here for reference.

Enclave

:   A protected area in an application's address space which provides
    confidentiality and integrity even in the presence of privileged
    malware.

    The term can also be used to refer to a specific enclave that has
    been initialized with a specific code and data.

Basename

:   A service provider base name. In our context the service provider
    entity is the distributed ledger network. Each distinct network
    should have its own Basename and Service Provider ID (see EPID and
    IAS specifications).

EPID

:   An anonymous credential system. See E. Brickell and Jiangtao Li:
    "Enhanced Privacy ID from Bilinear Pairing for Hardware
    Authentication and Attestation". IEEE International Conference on
    Social Computing / IEEE International Conference on Privacy,
    Security, Risk and Trust. 2010.

EPID Pseudonym

:   Pseudonym of an SGX platform used in linkable quotes. It is part of
    the IAS attestation response according to IAS API specifications. It
    is computed as a function of the service Basename (Sawtooth network,
    in our case) and the device\'s EPID private key.

PPK, PSK

:   PoET ECC public and private key created by the PoET enclave.

IAS Report Key

:   IAS public key used to sign attestation reports as specified in the
    current IAS API Guide.

PSEmanifest

:   Platform Services Enclave manifest. It is part of an SGX quote for
    enclaves using Platform Services like Trusted Time and Monotonic
    Counters.

AEP

:   Attestation evidence payload sent to IAS (see IAS API
    specifications). Contains JSON encodings of the quote, an optional
    PSEmanifest, and an optional nonce.

AVR

:   Attestation verification report, the response to a quote attestation
    request from the IAS. It is verified with the IAS Report Key. It
    contains a copy of the input AEP.

$WaitCertId_{n}$

:   The $n$-th or most recent WaitCertificate digest. We assume $n >= 0$
    represents the current number of blocks in the ledger. WaitCertId is
    a function of the contents of the Wait Certificate. For instance the
    SHA256 digest of the WaitCertificate ECDSA signature.

OPK, OSK

:   Originator ECDSA public and private key. These are the higher level
    ECDSA keys a validator uses to sign messages.

OPKhash

:   SHA256 digest of OPK

blockDigest

:   ECDSA signature with OSK of SHA256 digest of transaction block that
    the validator wants to commit.

localMean

:   Estimated wait time local mean.

MCID

:   SGX Monotonic Counter identifier.

SealKey

:   The SGX enclave Seal Key. It is used by the SGX `sgx_seal_data()`
    and `sgx_unseal_data()` functions.

PoetSealKey

:   The Poet SGX enclave Seal Key. It must be obtained through the SGX
    SDK `` `sgx_get_key() `` function passing a fixed 32 byte constant
    as `key_id` argument.

PoET_MRENCLAVE

:   Public MRENCLAVE (see SGX SDK documentation) value of valid PoET SGX
    enclave.

$T_{WT}$

:   WaitTimer timeout in seconds. A validator has at most $T_{WT}$
    seconds to consume a WaitTimer, namely obtain a WaitCertificate on
    it after the WaitTimer itself has expired.

$K$

:   Number of blocks a validator can commit before having to sign-up
    with a fresh PPK.

$c$

:   The \"sign-up delay\", i.e., number of blocks a validator has to
    wait after sign-up before starting to participate in elections.

minDuration

:   Minimum duration for a WaitTimer.

# P2P PoET SGX Enclave Specifications

9.  Return (waitCertificate, signature).

### Sign-up Phase

A participant joins as a validator by downloading the PoET SGX enclave
and a SPID certificate for the blockchain. The client side of the
validator runs the following sign-up procedure:

1.  Start PoET SGX enclave: ENC.

2.  Generate sign-up data:
    $(PPK, report, PSEmanifest, sealedSignUpData) =
    \textnormal{ENC.generateSignUpData(OPKhash)}$ The `report_data` (512
    bits) field in the report body includes the SHA256 digest of
    (OPKhash \| PPK).

3.  Ask SGX Quoting Enclave (QE) for linkable quote on the report (using
    the Sawtooth network\'s Basename).

4.  If Self Attestation is enabled in IAS API: request attestation of
    linkable quote and PSE manifest to IAS. The AEP sent to IAS must
    contain:

    -   isvEnclaveQuote: base64 encoded quote
    -   pseManifest: base64 encoded PSEmanifest
    -   nonce: $WaitCertId_{n}$

    The IAS sends back a signed AVR containing a copy of the input AEP
    and the EPID Pseudonym.

5.  If Self Attestation is enabled in IAS API: broadcast self-attested
    join request, (OPK, PPK, AEP, AVR) to known participants.

6.  If Self Attestation is NOT enabled in IAS API: broadcast join
    request, (OPK, PPK, quote, PSEmanifest) to known participants.

A validator has to wait for $c$ block to be published on the distributed
ledger before participating in an election.

The server side of the validator runs the following sign-up procedure:

1.  Wait for a join request.

2.  Upon arrival of a join request do the verification:

    If the join request is self attested (Self Attestation is enabled in
    IAS API): (OPK, PPK, AEP, AVR)

    a.  Verify AVR legitimacy using IAS Report Key and therefore quote
        legitimacy.
    b.  Verify the `report_data` field within the quote contains the
        SHA256 digest of (OPKhash \| PPK).
    c.  Verify the nonce in the AVR is equal to $WaitCertId_{n}$, namely
        the digest of the most recently committed block. It may be that
        the sender has not seen $WaitCertId_{n}$ yet and could be
        sending $WaitCertId_{n'}$ where $n'<n$. In this case the sender
        should be urged to updated the view of the ledger by appending
        the new blocks and retry. It could also happen that the
        receiving validator has not seen $WaitCertId_{n}$ in which case
        it should try to update the view of the ledger and verify again.
    d.  Verify MRENCLAVE value within quote is equal to PoET_MRENCLAVE
        (there could be more than one allowed value).
    e.  Verify PSE Manifest SHA256 digest in AVR is equal to SHA256
        digest of PSEmanifest in AEP.
    f.  Verify basename in the quote is equal to distributed ledger
        Basename.
    g.  Verify attributes field in the quote has the allowed value
        (normally the enclave must be in initialized state and not be a
        debug enclave).

    If the join request is not self attested (Self Attestation is NOT
    enabled in IAS API): (OPK, PPK, quote, PSEmanifest)

    a.  Create AEP with quote and PSEmanifest :
        -   isvEnclaveQuote: base64 encoded quote
        -   pseManifest: base64 encoded PSEmanifest
    b.  Send AEP to IAS. The IAS sends back a signed AVR.
    c.  Verify received AVR attests to validity of both quote and
        PSEmanifest and save EPID Pseudonym.
    d.  Verify `report_data` field within the quote contains the SHA256
        digest of (OPKhash \| PPK).
    e.  Verify MRENCLAVE value within quote is equal to PoET_MRENCLAVE
        (there could be more than one allowed value).
    f.  Verify basename in the quote is equal to distributed ledger
        Basename.
    g.  Verify attributes field in the quote has the allowed value
        (normally the enclave must be in initialized state and not be a
        debug enclave).

    If the verification fails, exit.

    If the verification succeeds but the SGX platform identified by the
    EPID Pseudonym in the quote has already signed up, ignore the join
    request, exit.

    If the verification succeeds:

    a.  Pass sign-up certificate of new participant (OPK, EPID
        Pseudonym, PPK, current $WaitCertId_{n}$ to upper layers for
        registration in EndPoint registry.
    b.  Goto 1.

### Election Phase

Assume the identifier of the most recent valid block is
$WaitCertId_{n}$. Broadcast messages are signed by a validator with its
PPK. To participate in the election phase a validator runs the following
procedure on the client side:

1.  Start the PoET SGX enclave: ENC.
2.  Read the sealedSignUpData from disk and load it into enclave:
    $ENC.\textnormal{unsealSignUpData}(sealedSignUpData)$
3.  Call $(waitTimer, signature) = ENC.createWaitTimer(localMean,
    WaitCertId_{n})$.
4.  Wait waitTimer.duration seconds.
5.  Call $(waitCertificate, signature) =
    ENC.createWaitCertificate(blockDigest)$.
6.  If the `createWaitCertificate()` call is successful, broadcast
    (waitCertificate, signature, block, OPK, PPK) where block is the
    transaction block identified by blockDigest.

On the server side, a validator waits for incoming (waitCertificate,
signature, block, OPK, PPK) tuples. When one is received the following
validity checks are performed:

1.  Verify the PPK and OPK belong to a registered validator by checking
    the EndPoint registry.
2.  Verify the signature is valid using sender\'s PPK.
3.  Verify the PPK was used by sender to commit less than $K$ blocks by
    checking EndPoint registry (otherwise sender needs to re-sign).
4.  Verify the waitCertificate.waitTimer.localMean is correct by
    comparing against localMean computed locally.
5.  Verify the waitCertificate.blockDigest is a valid ECDSA signature of
    the SHA256 hash of block using OPK.
6.  Verify the sender has been winning elections according to the
    expected distribution (see z-test documentation).
7.  Verify the sender signed up at least $c$ committed blocks ago, i.e.,
    respected the $c$ block start-up delay.

A valid waitCertificate is passed to the upper ledger layer and the
waitCertificate with the lowest value of
waitCertificate.waitTimer.duration determines the election winner.

### Revocation

Two mechanisms are put in place to blacklist validators whose EPID key
has been revoked by IAS. The first one affects each validator
periodically, although infrequently. The second one is an asynchronous
revocation check that each validator could perform on other validators\'
EPID keys at any time.

1.  **Periodic regeneration of PPK** a validator whose EPID key has been
    revoked by the IAS would not be able to obtain any valid AVR and
    therefore would be prevented from signing-up. Forcing validators to
    periodically re-sign with a fresh sign-up certificate leaves
    validators whose EPID keys have been revoked out of the system.
    Validators have to re-sign after they commit $K$ blocks and if they
    do not they are considered revoked.
2.  **Asynchronous sign-up quote verification** A validator can (at any
    time) ask IAS for attestation on a quote that another validator used
    to sign-up to check if its EPID key has been revoked since. If so,
    the returned AVR will indicate that the key is revoked. A validator
    that obtains such an AVR from IAS can broadcast it in a blacklisting
    transaction, so that all the validators can check the veracity of
    the AVR and proceed with the blacklisting. To limit the use of
    blacklisting transactions as a means to thwart liveness for
    malicious validators one can control the rate at which they can be
    committed in different ways:
    -   A certain number of participation tokens needs to be burned to
        commit a blacklisting transaction.
    -   A validator can commit a blacklisting transaction only once it
        wins one or more elections.
    -   A validator that commits a certain number of non-legit
        blacklisting transactions is blacklisted.

### Security Considerations

1.  $T_{WT}$ **motivation**: A validator has at most $T_{WT}$ seconds to
    consume a WaitTimer, namely obtain a WaitCertificate on it after the
    WaitTimer itself has expired. This constraint is enforced to avoid
    that in case there are no transactions to build a block for some
    time several validators might hold back after they waited the
    duration of their WaitTimers and generate the WaitCertificate only
    once enough transactions are available. At the point they will all
    send out their WaitCertificates generating a lot of traffic and
    possibly inducing forks. The timeout mitigates this problem.
2.  **Enclave compromise:** a compromised SGX platform that is able to
    arbitrarily win elections cannot affect the correctness of the
    system, but can hinder progress by publishing void transactions.
    This problem is mitigated by limiting the frequency with which a
    validator (identified by its PPK) can win elections in a given time
    frame (see z-test documentation).
3.  **WaitTimer duration manipulation:**
    a.  Imposing a $c$ block participation delay after sign-up prevents
        validators from generating different pairs of OPK, PPK and pick
        the one that would result in the lowest value of the next
        WaitTimer duration as follows:
        i.  Generate as many PPK,PSK pairs and therefore monotonic
            counters as possible.
        ii. Do not sign up but use all the enclaves (each using a
            different PPK, PSK and MCID) to create a WaitTimer every
            time a new block is committed until a very low duration is
            obtained (good chance of winning the election). Then collect
            all the different waitCertIds.
        iii. Ask each enclave to create the next waitTimer, whose
             duration depends on each of the different winning
             waitCertIds. Choose the PPK of the enclave giving me the
             lowest next duration and sign up with that.
        iv. As a result an attacker can win the first the election (with
            high probability) and can chain the above 3 steps to get a
            good chance of winning several elections in a row.
    b.  The nonce field in WaitCertificate is set to a random value so
        that a validator does not have control over the resulting
        $WaitCertId_{n}$. A validator winning an election could
        otherwise try different blockDigest input values to
        createWaitCertificate and broadcast the WaitCertificate whose
        $WaitCertId_{n}$ results in the lowest duration of its next
        WaitTimer.
    c.  The call `createWaitTimer()` in step 1 of the election phase
        (client side) is bound to the subsequent call to
        `createWaitCertificate()` by the internal state of the PoET
        enclave. More precisely only one call to
        `createWaitCertificate()` is allowed after a call to
        `createWaitTimer()` (and the duration has elapsed) as the value
        of the global active WaitTimer object activeWT is set to null at
        the end of `createWaitCertificate()` so that subsequent calls
        would fail. Therefore only one transaction block (identified by
        the input parameter blockDigest) can be attached to a
        WaitCertificate object. This prevents a malicious user from
        creating multiple WaitCertificates (each with a different nonce)
        resulting in different WaitCertId digests without re-creating a
        WaitTimer (and waiting for its duration) each time. It follows
        that as long as the duration of WaitTimer is not too small, a
        malicious validator that wins the current election has very
        limited control over the duration of its next WaitTimer.
    d.  The check on the Monotonic Counter value guarantees only one
        enclave instance can obtain a WaitCertificate after the
        WaitTimer duration elapses. This again prevents a malicious user
        from running multiple instances of the enclave to create
        multiple WaitCertificates (each with a different nonce)
        resulting in different WaitCertId digests and selecting the one
        that would result in the lowest duration for a new WaitTimer.
    e.  A monotonic counter with id MCID is created at the same time PPK
        and PSK are generated and the triple (MCID, PPK, PSK) is
        encrypted using AES-GCM with the Seal Key and saved in permanent
        storage. A malicious validator cannot run multiple enclave
        instances (before signing up) to create multiple monotonic
        counters without being forced to commit to using only one
        eventually. As a monotonic counter is bound to PPK, PSK through
        the AES-GCM encryption with the Seal Key, when a validator
        signs-up with a PPK it automatically commits to using the
        monotonic counter that was created along with PPK, PSK.
4.  **Sign-up AEP replay:** the use of the nonce field in the AEP, which
    is set equal to $WaitCertId_{n}$, is used to prevent the replay of
    old AEPs.

### Comments on Multi-user or Multi-ledger SGX Enclave Service

It is possible to use the same enclave for multiple users or ledgers by
providing username and ledgername as input parameters to
`generateSignUpData()` and `unsealSignUpData()`. Then the sign-up tuple
(username, ledgername, PPK, PSK, MCID) is sealed to disk, with username
and ledgername used to generate the filename. Anytime a user
authenticates to the service the latter can have the enclave unseal and
use the sign-up tuple from the file corresponding to that user (and
ledger).

# Population Size and Local Mean Computation

**Parameters**:

1.  targetWaitTime: the desired average wait time. This depends on the
    network diameter and is selected to minimize the probability of a
    collision.
2.  initialWaitTime: the initial wait time used in the bootstrapping
    phase until the ledger contains sampleLength blocks.
3.  sampleLength: number of blocks that need to be on the ledger to
    finish the bootstrapping phase
4.  minimumWaitTime: a lower bound on the wait time.

The population size is computed as follows:

1.  $sumMeans = 0$

2.  $sumWaits = 0$

3.  | **foreach** wait certificate $wc$ stored on the ledger:
    |   $sumWaits += wc\textrm{.duration}-\textrm{minimumWaitTime}$
    |   $sumMeans += wc\textrm{.localMean}$

4.  $populationSize = sumMeans / sumWaits$

Assuming $b$ is the number of blocks currently claimed, the local mean
is computed as follows:

1.  ```
    | if $b < \textrm{sampleLength}$ then
    |    $ratio = 1.0\cdot b / \textrm{sampleLength}$ and
    |    $\textrm{localMean} = \textrm{targetWaitTime}\cdot (1 - ratio^2) + \textrm{initialWaitTime}\cdot ratio^2$.
    ```

2.  `else $\textrm{localMean}= \textrm{targetWaitTime}\cdot
    \textrm{populationSize}$`

# z-test

A z-test is used to test the hypothesis that a validator won elections
at a higher average rate than expected.

**Parameters**:

1.  zmax: test value, it measures the maximum deviation from the
    expected mean. It is selected so that the desired confidence
    interval \$alpha\$ is obtained. Example configurations are:
    a.  $\textrm{ztest}=1.645 \leftrightarrow \alpha=0.05$
    b.  $\textrm{ztest}=2.325 \rightarrow \alpha=0.01$
    c.  $\textrm{ztest}=2.575 \rightarrow \alpha=0.005$
    d.  $\textrm{ztest}=3.075 \rightarrow \alpha=0.001$
2.  testValidatorId: the validator identifier under test.
3.  blockArray: an array containing pairs of validator identifier and
    estimated population size. Each pair represents one published
    transaction block.
4.  minObservedWins: minimum number of election wins that needs to be
    observed for the identifier under test.

The z-test is computed as follows:

    observedWins = expectedWins = blockCount = 0
    foreach block = (validatorId, populationEstimate) in blockArray:
        blockCount += 1
        expectedWins += 1 / populationEstimate

        if validatorId is equal to testValidatorId:
            observedWins += 1
            if observedWins > minObservedWins and observedWins > expectedWins:
                p = expectedWins / blockCount
                σ = sqrt(blockCount * p * (1.0 - p))
                z = (observedWins - expectedWins) / σ
                if z > zmax:
                    return False
    return True

If the z-test fails (False is returned) then the validator under test
won elections at a higher average rate than expected.

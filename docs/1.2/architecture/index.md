# Architecture Guide

The following diagram shows a high-level view of the Sawtooth
architecture.

This guide describes the design and architecture of
Sawtooth, an enterprise blockchain platform for building distributed
ledger applications and networks.

This guide starts by explaining the important concepts of
`global state` and `Sawtooth batches`. Next, it
describes key parts of the `validator` and other core features,
including the journal for block management, consensus, transaction
scheduling, permissioning, and more.
